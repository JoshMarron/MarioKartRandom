# MarioKartRandom
This is a small app for personal use which randomly selects vehicle parts for Mario Kart 8, and displays the stats of the vehicle in a table. The app has three main functions:

Random Kart Selector:

Chooses three random parts for each player, and displays their names and cumulative stats in tables.

Kart Builder:

Allows the user to specifically choose three parts for a Kart and displays the stats in a table.

Kart Recommender:

This feature is yet to be implemented, but will recommend Karts for each course based on the number of turns, variety of terrain, etc.

The app is designed with simplicity in mind and respects the conventions of Material Design. The interface is nicely divided up into reusable chunks to make development more fluid. Rotation now works fine with the app.
